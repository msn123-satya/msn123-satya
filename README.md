# 👋 Hi, I'm Makka Satyanarayana

I’m an aspiring full-stack developer passionate about building intelligent, interactive applications using AI and web technologies.

I recently built a **Smart AI Chatbot** that lets users interact via voice or text, powered by **Google Gemini Flash 2.0**. The backend is built with **FastAPI**, and the frontend uses **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It provides highly structured, user-friendly responses and includes voice-to-text support using the browser’s speech recognition.

I'm currently learning and building more real-world applications to sharpen my development and problem-solving skills.
